# e-commerce-back-end

## Description

For my 13th challenge, E-Commerce-Back-End, I was required to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Using the starter code I was provided, I had to configure a working API to utilize Sequelize to communicate with a MySQL database. With the help of Sequelize, model querying for needed data from a database was a breeze. Methods from Sequelize that I used for gathering data were findAll(), findByPk(), create(), update(), and destroy().
